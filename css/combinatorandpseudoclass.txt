single-selector are most commonly use but now we can use cominator which defines the relation between two selectors
some of the combinators are 
descendant selector:''
div p{
    font-size:44px;
}
child selector:
in this child selector we can use > sign to represent child selector.
this only includes the element that are in the article element but of any other html element like div make interfarance in between
and the p is in any then it won't work.

article>p{

}
adjacent sibling selector:
+ is the adj selector



general sibling selector:~
